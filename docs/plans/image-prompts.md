# Image Prompts

Prompts for generating images used in the deck. Use these with Gemini or similar AI image generators.

## Slide 36: "Meet your AI colleague" (Dory)

> Create an image of a friendly cartoon blue tang fish, side profile facing right, in a Pixar-style 3D rendering. Bright blue body with a yellow tail fin, big expressive eyes, and a cheerful but slightly confused smile — like it just forgot what it was doing. The background should be a solid dark navy color (hex #0F0F1A). Soft, warm lighting. No text, no watermarks, no other objects. The image should be square, high resolution, with the fish centered and taking up about 60% of the frame. Style: clean, polished, suitable for a professional presentation slide.

**Why blue tang:** It's Dory's species (Finding Nemo) without being Dory herself — avoids copyright. The "helpful but confused" expression sells the metaphor (brilliant, helpful, remembers nothing).

**Placement:** Save as `images/dory.png` and it will be wired into slide 36, replacing the fish icon placeholder inside the teal rectangle.
