# Getting Agents to Give Up Their Secrets - Content Outline

> **Next step:** Use **/deck-flow:design** to plan slides and visual direction.

## Overview
- **Estimated duration**: Self-paced reference document (no fixed duration)
- **Total sections**: 7
- **Estimated slides**: ~68 (billboard design — one idea per slide)
- **Narrative doc**: [narrative.md](narrative.md)

## Content Outline

### Section 1: Opening — "Where Are You?"
**Key message**: AI is a massive opportunity and you're already equipped — you just need to learn the trick.
**Content**:
- Title + hook: "45 minutes on a one-page summary. The right approach took 2 minutes."
- "This deck is about the trick."
- 7-persona spectrum (Skeptic → Explorer → Whisperer → Strategist → Operator → Orchestrator → Builder). Most people at Explorer. Deck takes you to Orchestrator. Builder dimmed as horizon.
- Stats: 1B+ users (DataReportal), <2% premium (Reuters), tech adoption timeline, $4.4T value / 31% production (McKinsey, ServiceNow)
- "The core skill for AI is talking. You already have it."
- Breather transition
**Emphasis**: High
**Speaker notes**: Let the hook land. Don't rush the spectrum — let people find themselves. Stats build urgency without overwhelming.
**Transition**: "Let's see what most people get wrong."

### Section 2: Skeptic → Explorer — "Know Your Tools"
**Key message**: AI is simpler than the jargon makes it seem. The gap between using AI and using it well is massive.
**Content**:
- Buzzword blizzard (intentional overwhelm)
- Questions from the chaos (ChatGPT vs GPT? What's an agent?)
- AI stack: App → Agent → API → LLM
- Who makes what (table)
- "The real action is in agents and apps."
- 41% of GitHub code AI-generated (Second Talent) / 19% longer without understanding (Addy Osmani) / 10× Copilot growth (Microsoft Q2 2026)
- "The gap between using AI and using AI well is massive."
- Breather transition
**Emphasis**: Medium
**Speaker notes**: The jargon wall is intentional — let it hit. The stack simplification should feel like relief. Stats prove the gap is real.
**Transition**: "You've got the basics. Now let's give you the skills."

---

### Section 3: Explorer → Whisperer — "Talk to AI Properly"
**Key message**: The same task with better words produces dramatically better results — and it's five simple techniques.
**Content**:
- Section divider: "Prompt Engineering"
- Baseline prompt (chat bubble: vague onboarding request → generic output)
- 5 Wrong/Right iterations: Role, Specificity, One Task, Power Keywords, Output Format
- Before/after comparison
- "Same task. Same information. Just better words."
- Cliffhanger: "But we never changed what the AI knew."
- Breather transition
**Emphasis**: High (the Wrong/Right slides are the most visually distinctive in the deck)
**Speaker notes**: Each iteration builds on the last. The before/after should feel like a reveal. The cliffhanger sets up the entire next section.
**Transition**: "You've changed the words. Now let's change the information."

---

### Section 4: Whisperer → Strategist — "Feed AI Smarter"
**Key message**: The biggest quality leap comes from what AI knows, not how you ask. And you can make that knowledge permanent.
**Content**:
- "Same prompt. Different information. Dramatically different result."
- Side-by-side: "Plausible but generic" vs "Sounds like someone who works here"
- Meet your AI colleague (blue tang image) — "Brilliant. Helpful. Remembers nothing."
- Attention problem: "Too much. Contradictory. Too broad." (Sombra)
- "Let AI tell you what it needs." — the clarifying questions technique (Anthropic/Claude)
- "Not too much. Not too little." — goldilocks principle (CIO)
- **Skills as persistent context** (relocated from Orchestrator):
  - "You've mastered context. But you're providing it from scratch every time."
  - GPS metaphor: directions every trip vs. GPS that remembers
  - "Custom instructions = System prompts = Rules = Skills"
  - (CodeConductor)
- Breather transition
**Emphasis**: High (the Dory introduction and the skills relocation make this the pivotal section)
**Speaker notes**: The context proof should feel like an "aha." Dory explains why. Skills are the natural conclusion — "do I have to do this every time? No." GPS metaphor crystallizes the whole section.
**Transition**: "You talk to AI like a pro. You've set up its playbook. But who's doing all the work? Still you."

---

### Section 5: Strategist → Operator — "Let AI Drive"
**Key message**: Stop being the bottleneck. Let agents work, you review.
**Content**:
- Copy-paste trap: You search → You paste → AI drafts → You apply
- "You're using a Ferrari to carry groceries."
- Agent-driven: Agent retrieves → Agent identifies gaps → Agent creates → You review
- "Same colleague. Now she has hands."
- 6 connection icons: Web, Email, Docs, Data, Calendar, Custom
- Without/With comparison (budget memo story)
- "Trust, but verify." + three rules
- "AI is a power tool, not autopilot."
- "When the answer 'feels right' but you can't verify it — that's the most dangerous moment."
- Breather transition
**Emphasis**: Medium (solid teaching section, emotionally important for the trust beats)
**Speaker notes**: The copy-paste trap makes the invisible visible. The trust slides should land at exactly the moment the reader feels uneasy about handing AI the keys.
**Transition**: "You're managing AI well. Time to orchestrate it."

---

### Section 6: Operator → Orchestrator — "Orchestrate"
**Key message**: One agent is powerful. A coordinated team of agents with compounding skills is transformative.
**Content**:
- Kitchen brigade: one chef vs four stations
- "The trick isn't making one AI smarter. It's making many work together."
- Chain flow: Research → Draft → Review → You
- "Each agent does one thing. The chain does everything."
- Skills per agent (brief — audience already knows skills): "You already set up skills for yourself. Now each agent gets its own." Research Agent + Research Standards, Draft Agent + Leadership Proposals, Review Agent + Compliance Policy.
- "Skills compound. The brigade gets smarter every time."
- 1.5 hrs (bottleneck) vs 15 min (judgment)
- "Same proposal. The chain gets smarter every time. Your feedback becomes skills. She won't remember, but the skills will."
**Emphasis**: High (this is the climax — the payoff of the entire deck)
**Speaker notes**: The 1.5hrs vs 15min comparison is the emotional peak of the teaching content. The skills-compounding beat is the final colleague touchpoint.
**Transition**: Straight into closing — ride the momentum.

---

### Section 7: Closing — "Full Circle"
**Key message**: The trick was never in the AI. Now go try it.
**Content**:
- Breather: "Let's come back to where we started."
- "Remember the 45-minute summary?"
- "Two minutes. That's the trick."
- "The secret was never in the AI." / "Now go try it — one task, this week."
**Emphasis**: High (emotional peak — every slide in the closing is a punchline)
**Speaker notes**: Callback traces the journey through new personas: Explorer → Whisperer → Strategist → Operator → Orchestrator. Long pause after "Two minutes." Let it land.
