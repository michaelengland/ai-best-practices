# AI Academy — Pitch Deck Narrative

> **Next step:** Use **/deck-flow:craft** to structure this narrative into a content outline.

## Overview

- **Audience**: Company-wide — all roles, all levels. Most have tried ChatGPT. Few use it seriously.
- **Purpose**: Get people excited to attend the AI Academy workshops. They should leave thinking "I need to sign up for this."
- **Key message**: You're already using AI. You're just not using it well. The AI Academy fixes that in four lunch sessions.
- **Framework**: Problem → Solution → Impact
- **Tone**: Same as the main deck — playful, provocative, not corporate. Borrow the energy, not the depth.
- **Format**: ~12 slides, ~5 minutes presented live. Billboard design (reuse main deck's visual system).

## Narrative Arc

### Opening: The Hook

Borrow the 45-minute story from the main deck — it's proven and relatable:

- "Last month, someone spent 45 minutes on a one-page summary using ChatGPT. The right approach took 2 minutes."
- **Pivot to organizational scope:** "What if your whole team knew the trick?"

This shifts from individual anecdote to company opportunity in one line.

### The Gap: Why This Matters

Hit with the 3 most compelling stats (borrowed from main deck):

- 1 billion+ use AI tools monthly. <2% use them well. (Sources: DataReportal, Reuters)
- 41% of GitHub code is AI-generated. But developers who rely on AI without understanding it take 19% longer. (Sources: Second Talent, Addy Osmani)
- "The gap between using AI and using AI well is massive."

The audience should think: "That gap exists in our team too."

### The Spectrum: Where You Are

Show the 7-persona spectrum (borrowed from main deck):

- Skeptic → Explorer → Whisperer → Strategist → Operator → Orchestrator → Builder
- "Most of us are here." (Explorer highlighted)
- "The AI Academy takes you here." (Orchestrator indicated)

Self-identification moment — same as the main deck but now it's a teaser, not a teaching tool.

### The Solution: AI Academy

Introduce the academy — four hands-on workshops:

- "Four sessions. One lunch hour each. Bring your laptop."
- The curriculum as persona crossings:
  - Session 1: **Explorer → Whisperer** — Learn to talk to AI properly
  - Session 2: **Whisperer → Strategist** — Make AI remember what you need
  - Session 3: **Strategist → Operator** — Let AI work for you
  - Session 4: **Operator → Orchestrator** — Coordinate AI teams
- "Not lectures. You'll have ChatGPT open. You'll do the work. You'll see the difference in real time."

### CTA: Sign Up

- "First session: [date]. Bring your laptop and a task you do every week."
- Simple, specific, low-commitment ask.

## Notes

- **Visual system**: Reuse the main deck's billboard design — dark bg, teal accent, Georgia/Calibri, same color system. This pitch should feel like part of the same family.
- **Slide reuse**: The hook, stats, spectrum, and "gap is massive" slides can be borrowed nearly verbatim from the main deck. The academy curriculum and CTA are new.
- **Presenter**: This deck is meant to be presented live (unlike the main deck which is self-paced). Speaker notes should include timing cues.
- **Adaptability**: The [date] placeholder in the CTA should be filled in before each use.
