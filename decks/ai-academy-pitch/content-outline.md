> **Next step:** Use **/deck-flow:design** to plan slides and visual direction.

## Overview
- **Estimated duration**: ~5 minutes (presented live)
- **Total sections**: 4
- **Narrative doc**: [narrative.md](narrative.md)

## Content Outline

### Section 1: The Hook — "What if your whole team knew?"
**Key message**: There's a massive gap between using AI and using it well — and it costs real time.
**Content**:
- "Last month, someone spent 45 minutes on a one-page summary. The right approach took 2 minutes."
- "What if your whole team knew the trick?"
- 1B+ use AI monthly. <2% use it well. (DataReportal, Reuters)
- 41% of code is AI-generated. 19% longer without understanding. (Second Talent, Addy Osmani)
- "The gap between using AI and using AI well is massive."
**Emphasis**: High
**Speaker notes**: Hook lands fast — 30 seconds max. Stats build urgency. ~90 seconds total.
**Transition**: "So where does your team sit?"

### Section 2: The Spectrum — "Most of us are here"
**Key message**: There's a clear progression from beginner to expert, and most people are near the start.
**Content**:
- 7-persona spectrum: Skeptic → Explorer → Whisperer → Strategist → Operator → Orchestrator → Builder
- "Most of us are here." (Explorer)
- "The AI Academy takes you here." (Orchestrator)
**Emphasis**: Medium
**Speaker notes**: Let people find themselves. Don't rush. ~30 seconds.
**Transition**: "Here's how we get there."

### Section 3: The Academy — "Four sessions, four levels"
**Key message**: The AI Academy is four practical, hands-on lunch sessions that progressively level you up.
**Content**:
- "Four sessions. One lunch hour each. Bring your laptop."
- Session 1: Explorer → Whisperer — learn to talk to AI properly
- Session 2: Whisperer → Strategist — make AI remember what you need
- Session 3: Strategist → Operator — let AI work for you
- Session 4: Operator → Orchestrator — coordinate AI teams
- "Not lectures. You'll have ChatGPT open. You'll do the work."
**Emphasis**: High (this is the sell)
**Speaker notes**: Emphasize hands-on. "You'll see the difference in real time." ~90 seconds.
**Transition**: "Ready?"

---

### Section 4: CTA — "Bring your laptop and a task"
**Key message**: Sign up, show up, bring a real task.
**Content**:
- "First session: [date]"
- "Bring your laptop and a task you do every week."
**Emphasis**: Medium
**Speaker notes**: Simple, specific, low-commitment. ~30 seconds.

## Design Notes
- **Visual system**: Reuse the main deck's billboard design — dark bg `0F0F1A`, teal accent `00B4D8`, Georgia/Calibri, same color system
- **Slide reuse**: Hook, stats, spectrum, and "gap is massive" slides borrowed from the main deck with minimal changes
- **Presenter deck**: Unlike the main reference deck, this is designed for live delivery. Speaker notes should include timing cues.
- **Adaptability**: [date] placeholder in CTA should be filled before each use
