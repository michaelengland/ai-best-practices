# AI Academy — Pitch Deck Slide Design

> **Next step:** Use **/deck-flow:present** to generate the .pptx file.

## Visual Direction

Inherited from the main deck — same family, same system.

- **Color palette**: Dark bg `0F0F1A` (60%) / text `E0E4E8` + muted `94A3B8` (30%) / teal accent `00B4D8` (10%)
- **Typography**: Georgia (headings) + Calibri (body). Hero 72-120pt, Headline 44pt, Support 28pt, Sources 11pt
- **Visual style**: Billboard — 3-second test, 15 words max, 50%+ whitespace. Radial glow on dark slides.

## Slide Plan

### Slide 1: Title
**Layout**: Title slide
**Content**: "AI Academy" / "From Explorer to Orchestrator in four lunch hours"
**Speaker notes**: Brief. Let the title sit. ~10 seconds.

### Slide 2: The Hook
**Layout**: Single message (28pt Calibri)
**Content**: "Last month, someone spent 45 minutes on a one-page summary using ChatGPT. The right approach took 2 minutes."
**Speaker notes**: Same hook as the main deck — proven and relatable. Let it land. ~15 seconds.

### Slide 3: The Pivot
**Layout**: Single message (44pt hero)
**Content**: "What if your whole team knew the trick?"
**Speaker notes**: This is the shift from individual anecdote to organizational opportunity. Pause. ~10 seconds.

### Slide 4: The Stats
**Layout**: Big number + support (two stats combined)
**Content**: "1 billion+" / "use AI tools monthly. Less than 2% use them well."
**Speaker notes**: Source: DataReportal 2026, Reuters. Mass adoption but shallow depth. ~15 seconds.

### Slide 5: The Twist
**Layout**: Big number (red)
**Content**: "19% longer" / "when you rely on AI without understanding it"
**Speaker notes**: Source: Addy Osmani. Developers who felt faster actually took longer. The gap isn't just unused potential — it's active harm. ~15 seconds.

### Slide 6: The Gap
**Layout**: Single message (44pt hero)
**Content**: "The gap between using AI and using AI well is massive."
**Speaker notes**: Let this land. The audience should be thinking "that's us." ~10 seconds.

### Slide 7: The Spectrum
**Layout**: Diagram — 7 persona boxes (reuse from main deck)
**Content**: Skeptic → Explorer → Whisperer → Strategist → Operator → Orchestrator → Builder. "Most of us are here." (Explorer) / "The AI Academy takes you here." (Orchestrator)
**Speaker notes**: Same spectrum as the main deck. Self-identification moment. ~20 seconds.

### Slide 8: The Academy
**Layout**: Single message (44pt hero) + support
**Content**: "Four sessions. One lunch hour each." / "Bring your laptop."
**Speaker notes**: The sell starts here. Emphasize: practical, time-bound, low-commitment. ~15 seconds.

### Slide 9: The Curriculum
**Layout**: Four rows (steps layout)
**Content**:
- Session 1: Explorer → Whisperer — "Learn to talk to AI properly"
- Session 2: Whisperer → Strategist — "Make AI remember what you need"
- Session 3: Strategist → Operator — "Let AI work for you"
- Session 4: Operator → Orchestrator — "Coordinate AI teams"
**Speaker notes**: Walk through each briefly. Each one-liner should create curiosity. "Learn to talk to AI properly" — what does that even mean? Come find out. ~30 seconds.

### Slide 10: CTA
**Layout**: Single message + support
**Content**: "First session: [date]" / "Bring your laptop and a task you do every week."
**Speaker notes**: Specific, low-commitment ask. "Not a task you want to learn — a task you already do. You'll transform it live." ~15 seconds.
