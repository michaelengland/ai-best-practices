# Workshop: Explorer → Whisperer — Narrative

> **Next step:** Use **/deck-flow:craft** to structure this narrative into a content outline.

## Overview

- **Audience**: People who have tried ChatGPT but use it like a search engine. They type vague prompts, get mediocre results, and blame the AI. They attended the pitch or read the reference deck and self-identify as Explorers.
- **Purpose**: By the end, attendees can transform a vague prompt into a professional-quality one using 5 techniques. They should feel the difference in real time.
- **Key message**: The same task with better words produces dramatically better results — and it's five simple techniques you can learn in one lunch hour.
- **Framework**: Show → Do → Compare (each technique is taught, then immediately practiced, then the output is compared to the previous attempt)
- **Tone**: Encouraging, hands-on. "Let's try it together" energy. Not a lecture — a lab.
- **Format**: ~25-30 slides, ~45 min effective (60 min session minus pizza/settling). Billboard design. ChatGPT required.

## Session Structure

### Opening: Where We're At (3-5 min)

- Show the spectrum. Highlight Explorer → Whisperer crossing.
- "You've tried AI. Today you learn to talk to it properly."
- Quick level set: "AI apps (like ChatGPT) use language models. You talk, they respond. The quality of what comes back depends almost entirely on what you put in."
- The AI stack in one sentence: "You use apps. Apps use agents. Agents talk to LLMs. You only need to care about the first two."

### Exercise Setup (2 min)

- "Open ChatGPT on your laptop. We're going to transform the same task 5 times."
- Prescribe the task OR let them choose: "Pick a real task you do at work — a proposal, an email, a summary, a plan. Something you'd spend 20-30 minutes on."
- **Prescribed fallback**: "Write me a proposal for improving our onboarding process." (the running example from the main deck)

### Round 1: The Baseline (5 min)

- **Teach** (1 min): "Most people type something vague and hope for the best. Let's see what that gets us."
- **Exercise**: Type your vague, natural prompt into ChatGPT. Read the output.
- **Discuss**: "Sound familiar? Generic. Surface-level. Could be for any company."
- **Pause slide**: Clear instruction on what to type.

### Round 2: Assign a Role (5 min)

- **Teach** (1 min): "Adding a role changes the AI's default tone, depth, and perspective. One sentence of setup."
- **Exercise**: Add "You are a senior [relevant role]" to the beginning of your prompt. Re-run.
- **Compare**: "Look at your first output vs this one. Notice the terminology, the frameworks, the level of detail."
- **Pause slide**: Show the wrong/right pattern — vague prompt vs role-assigned prompt.

### Round 3: Be Specific (5 min)

- **Teach** (1 min): "Specificity in = specificity out. Tell it WHO it's for, WHAT the constraints are, HOW long it should be."
- **Exercise**: Add audience, constraints, and scope to your prompt. Re-run.
- **Compare**: The output now addresses a specific situation, not a generic one.

### Round 4: One Task at a Time (5 min)

- **Teach** (1 min): "The kitchen-sink prompt — 5 requests tangled together — tries everything, nails nothing. Give it structure."
- **Exercise**: Structure your prompt with numbered sections or clear steps. Re-run.
- **Compare**: The AI mirrors your organization.

### Round 5: Power Keywords (5 min)

- **Teach** (1 min): "'Be radically honest.' 'Think step by step.' 'Challenge my assumptions.' These keywords change the AI's behavior more than you'd expect."
- **Exercise**: Add 2-3 power keywords to your prompt. Re-run.
- **Compare**: Notice the AI pushing back, flagging uncertainty, being more thoughtful.

### Round 6: Define the Output (5 min)

- **Teach** (1 min): "You wouldn't ask a designer for 'something nice.' Tell the AI what format, tone, length, and audience you need."
- **Exercise**: Add output definition. Re-run.
- **Compare**: The output is now immediately usable — right format, right tone, right length.

### The Reveal (3 min)

- "Open your first output and your last output side by side."
- "Same task. Same information. Just better words."
- This is the emotional peak — the transformation is visceral because they did it themselves.

### Closing: What's Next (3 min)

- "You're now a Whisperer. You know how to talk to AI."
- **The cliffhanger** (borrowed from main deck): "But we never changed what the AI knew. Next session, we change the information — and the results jump again."
- "Next time: Whisperer → Strategist. Same lunch hour. Bring the prompt you built today."

## Notes

- **Running example consistency**: Ideally attendees use the same task across all 4 workshops, building on their work each time. The prompt they build today becomes the starting point for Workshop 2.
- **Prescribed vs. free choice**: Free choice is more engaging but harder to support. Recommend offering both: "Use your own task, or follow along with our example."
- **Timing is tight**: 6 rounds × 5 min = 30 min of exercises. Plus 15 min of opening/closing/transitions. If a round runs long, Round 4 (One Task at a Time) can be shortened to a demo rather than full exercise.
- **Pause slides**: Each exercise needs a clear "YOUR TURN" slide with specific instructions. Not "try adding a role" but "Add this exact sentence to the beginning of your prompt: 'You are a senior [your role] at [your company].'"
