# Workshop: Whisperer → Strategist — Narrative

> **Next step:** Use **/deck-flow:craft** to structure this narrative into a content outline.

## Overview

- **Audience**: Attendees who completed Workshop 1. They can write good prompts. They don't yet understand context engineering or skills (persistent instructions).
- **Purpose**: By the end, attendees understand that WHAT the AI knows matters more than HOW you ask, and they've set up their first custom instruction (skill) in ChatGPT.
- **Key message**: You've learned to ask well. Now make AI remember — so you never have to ask the same way twice.
- **Framework**: Show → Do → Compare (same pattern as Workshop 1, extended to context and skills)
- **Tone**: "You thought the last session was the big unlock? This one's bigger."
- **Format**: ~25 slides, ~45 min effective. Billboard design. ChatGPT required.

## Session Structure

### Opening: Where We're At (3-5 min)

- Show the spectrum. Highlight Whisperer → Strategist crossing.
- "Last time you learned to talk to AI. Today you learn to make it remember."
- Quick recap: "You built a great prompt. Role, specifics, structure, keywords, output format. But every time you start a new conversation, you type all of that again."

### Exercise 1: Context Changes Everything (8 min)

- **Teach** (2 min): "Every iteration in the last workshop changed the words. We never changed what the AI knew. Watch what happens when we do."
- **Exercise**: Take the prompt from Workshop 1 (or the prescribed one). Add 3-4 sentences of real context: "Our company has 500 employees. Current onboarding takes 4 weeks. HR team of 3. Last attempt to fix this failed because..."
- **Compare**: Output goes from "plausible but generic" to "sounds like someone who works here."
- **The aha**: "Same prompt. Different information. Dramatically different result."

### Meet Your AI Colleague (2 min)

- Show the blue tang slide (borrowed from main deck).
- "Brilliant. Helpful. Remembers nothing."
- "Every conversation starts from scratch. She doesn't know your company, your role, or what you told her yesterday."

### Exercise 2: Let AI Tell You What It Needs (5 min)

- **Teach** (1 min): "Instead of guessing what context to provide, let AI ask."
- **Exercise**: Add to your prompt: "Before you start, ask me clarifying questions about anything you'd need to know."
- **Discuss**: "Look at what it asked. Did it surface things you hadn't thought of?"
- This is the single highest-leverage technique.

### The Problem: From Scratch Every Time (2 min)

- "You just pasted all that context manually. Your role, your company, your preferences."
- "Next conversation? You'll do it all again."
- "What if the AI already knew?"

### Exercise 3: Set Up Your First Skill (10 min)

- **Teach** (3 min): Walk through ChatGPT's Custom Instructions settings. Show where to find them. Explain what goes in each field.
- **Exercise**: Set up a custom instruction:
  - "I work at [company]. My role is [role]."
  - "When writing proposals, use [format]. Tone: [style]. Audience: [who]."
  - "Be radically honest. Challenge my assumptions. Flag uncertainty."
- **Test it**: Open a new conversation. Type ONLY the task — no role, no context, no format instructions. Just: "Write a proposal for reducing onboarding from 4 to 2 weeks."
- **Compare**: The output already knows your role, your format, your tone. You typed one sentence.

### Exercise 4: The Before/After (5 min)

- **Exercise**: Open your very first output from Workshop 1 (the vague prompt with no context). Compare it to this one (good prompt + custom instruction + context).
- Three outputs side by side: Vague → Well-prompted → Skill-enhanced.
- "Same task. Three versions. Each one dramatically better."

### The GPS Metaphor (2 min)

- "Prompt engineering = giving directions every trip. Skills = a GPS that remembers."
- "One requires effort every time. The other compounds permanently."
- "Custom instructions, system prompts, project rules — all the same thing. All skills."

### Closing: What's Next (3 min)

- "You're now a Strategist. You don't just talk to AI well — you've set up its playbook."
- **The cliffhanger**: "But who's doing all the work? Still you. Copy, paste, find the file, paste again. Next session, the AI does that itself."
- "Next time: Strategist → Operator. Bring your custom instructions — we're building on them."

## Notes

- **Exercise 3 is the linchpin**: If setting up custom instructions takes too long (people struggling with settings), the whole session stalls. Prepare a screen-share walkthrough and have a "follow along with me" backup.
- **ChatGPT custom instructions location**: Settings → Personalization → Custom Instructions. This changes periodically — verify before each session.
- **Context portability**: Attendees should save their custom instructions text somewhere (notes app, doc) so they can reuse it across tools. ChatGPT custom instructions aren't the only place — Claude has project rules, etc.
- **If time is short**: Exercise 4 (the three-way comparison) can become a facilitator demo instead of individual exercise.
